This project focuses on using time series analysis methods, in particular Holt-Winters and ARIMA, to forecast unemployment data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). The purpose of this project is to explore how different time series models can be applied to real-world data, and to compare the performance of these models on the unemployment data.

## Usage

To get started, create and activate the environment with

```console
$ conda/mamba env create
$ conda activate tsaf
